# Ark Console

**Your Business Runs Itself**

Autonomous Business Infrastructure

## Overview

Ark Console is autonomous infrastructure for business operations. AI handles the routine — monitoring, optimizing, executing — while humans supervise. 90 days from onboarding to full autonomy.

## Core Philosophy

The system operates on five non-negotiable axioms:

1. **Safety Priority** - Features only exist if they reduce risk
2. **Graduated Autonomy** - Trust is earned through evidence, not granted
3. **Human Supervision** - People observe and approve, not continuously steer
4. **Downward Power Flow** - Autonomy reduces automatically when confidence drops
5. **Visible Uncertainty** - Ambiguity blocks progress by default

## The Process

**Onboard → Stabilize → Automate**

1. **Onboard** - Connect systems, ingest data, establish baselines
2. **Stabilize** - Build control instruments and governance rails
3. **Automate** - Graduate to autonomous operations after 90-day stability proof

## Five Autonomy Levels

- **L0 Shadow Mode** - Observation and logging only
- **L1 Advisory** - Draft actions with consequence preview
- **L2 Reversible Execution** - Only undo-able actions permitted
- **L3 Bounded Execution** - Pre-approved low-risk actions with strict caps
- **L4 Full Self-Driving** - Full operating authority with weekly evidence

Autonomy moves downward automatically. Upward requires gate re-validation.

## Seven Core Modules

1. **Reality Intake** - Data ingestion without inference
2. **Control Instrument Registry** - Tracks authorizations and control instruments
3. **Cash Supervision** - Expected vs actual cash flow monitoring
4. **Disbursement Governance** - Approval matrices and reserve protection
5. **Authority Graph** - Who can do what, under which authority, until when
6. **Decision Visibility** - Complete audit trail of actions and blocks
7. **Evidence Packet Generator** - Weekly immutable proof of discipline

## Design Philosophy

> "If Ark Console feels empowering, it is wrong."

The system should feel calm, conservative, boring, and hard to misuse.
